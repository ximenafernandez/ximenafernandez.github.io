<h3>Specialist in Mathematical Modelling.</h3>
<p>I was part of the project of optimization of energetic resources, developing mixed linear programming models and stochastic dynamical programming models.  I also designed a model for prediction of demand of electric energy in Argentina.  I used machine learning, combinatorial optimization and statistical tools.  I developed software in Python,  Fortran and VisualBasic. I used as input the historical data of electric production and demand, as well as external meteorological and economical features that had latent predictive qualities for this problem.</p>

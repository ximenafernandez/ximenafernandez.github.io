Hi! I am a postdoc at
[Durham University](https://www.durham.ac.uk/), working with [Jeffrey Giansiracusa](https://sites.google.com/view/jeffreygiansiracusa/home). I am also member of the [EPSRC Centre for Topological Data Analysis](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/topological-data-analysis). I am working on density-based methods in manifold learning, and its applications to the study of high dimensional dynamical systems.

I earned
my Ph.D in Mathematics from the
[University of Buenos Aires](http://web.dm.uba.ar/), under the supervision of [El√≠as Gabriel Minian](http://mate.dm.uba.ar/~gminian/). In my [thesis](http://cms.dm.uba.ar/academico/carreras/doctorado/Tesis_Ximena_Fernandez.pdf), I approached different classical problems in low dimensional Algebraic Topology from a combinatorial and computational point of view. In particular, I developed 
[software](code) in SAGE and GAP related to the theory of Finite Topological Spaces.

My [research interests](research) concentrate  on Applied Algebraic Topology, Topological Data Analysis, Computational and Combinatorial Topology. While I focus on the theoretical development, most of my current research is motivated by applications in real life problems.

Hi! I am a Lecturer at the Department of Mathematics of
City University of London, . My [research interests](research) concentrate on Applied Algebraic Topology, Homotopy Theory and Topological Data Analysis. While I focus on the theoretical methods, most of my current research is motivated by applications in real life problems. 



I earned
my Ph.D in Mathematics from the
[University of Buenos Aires](http://web.dm.uba.ar/), under the supervision of [El√≠as Gabriel Minian](http://mate.dm.uba.ar/~gminian/). In my [thesis](http://cms.dm.uba.ar/academico/carreras/doctorado/Tesis_Ximena_Fernandez.pdf),  I addressed various classical problems in low-dimensional Algebraic Topology from combinatorial and computational perspectives. After working as a data scientist for two years in Argentina, I joined the UK Centre for Topological Data Analysis, holding postdoctoral positions at Swansea/Durham Universities with Jeffrey Giansuracusa and later at the University of Oxford with Heather Harrington. My focus was on methods and applications based on algebraic topology and geometry for data analysis in fields such as neuroscience and dynamics.

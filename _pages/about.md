Hi! I am a Lecturer in the Department of Mathematics at City, University of London. My research interests focus on Applied Algebraic Topology, Homotopy Theory, and Topological Data Analysis. While I emphasize theoretical methods, much of my current research is motivated by real-life applications.

I earned my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Buenos Aires, under the supervision of Elías Gabriel Minian. In my thesis, I addressed various classical problems in low-dimensional Algebraic Topology from combinatorial and computational perspectives. After working as a data scientist for two years in Argentina, I joined the UK Centre for Topological Data Analysis, holding postdoctoral positions at Swansea/Durham Universities with Jeffrey Giansuracusa and later at the University of Oxford with Heather Harrington. My research focused on methods and applications based on algebraic topology and geometry for data analysis in fields such as neuroscience and dynamics.

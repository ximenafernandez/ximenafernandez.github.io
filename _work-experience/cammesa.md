<p>I was part of the project of optimization of energetic resources,developing mixed linear programming models and stochasticdynamical programming models.  I also designed a model forprediction of demand of electric energy in Argentina.  I usedmachine learning, combinatorial optimization and statisticaltools.  I developed software in Python,  Fortran and VisualBasic. I used as input the historical data of electric productionand demand, as well as external meteorological and economicalfeatures that had latent predictive qualities for this problem.</p>

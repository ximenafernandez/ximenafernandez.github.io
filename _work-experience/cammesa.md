<h2>Specialist in Mathematical Modeling.</h2>
<p>I was part of the project of optimization of energetic resources ,developing mixed linear programming models and stochasticdynamical programming models.  I also designed a model forprediction of demand of electric energy in Argentina.  I used machine learning, combinatorial optimization and statisticaltools.  I developed software in Python,  Fortran and VisualBasic. I used as input the historical data of electric production and demand, as well as external meteorological and economica lfeatures that had latent predictive qualities for this problem.</p>

I developed models for:  prediction of the price of properties, recommender systems, statistical reports and data analysis. I used machine learning, deep learning and statistical tools, using as input for the models the historical data of advertisements published in the web page, and the interaction of users with the  web  platform.   I  developed  software  in  Python  and  I deployed the models using Google Cloud tools.

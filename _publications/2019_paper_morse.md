excerpt: '<span style='font-size: 15px'> We introduce novel combinatorial methods to study 3-deformations of CW-complexes of dimension 2 or, equivalently, Q∗∗-transformations of group presentations. Our procedures are based on a new version of Discrete Morse Theory for n-deformations. We apply these techniques to show that some known potential counterexamples to the Andrews-Curtis conjecture do satisfy the conjecture.'

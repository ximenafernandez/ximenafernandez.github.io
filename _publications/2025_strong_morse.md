The purpose of this work is to develop a version of Forman's discrete Morse theory for simplicial complexes, based on internal strong collapses. Classical discrete Morse theory can be viewed as a generalization of Whitehead's collapses, where each Morse function on a simplicial complex K defines a sequence of elementary internal collapses. This reduction guarantees the existence of a CW-complex that is homotopy equivalent to K, with cells corresponding to the critical simplices of the Morse function. However, this approach lacks an explicit combinatorial description of the attaching maps, which limits the reconstruction of the homotopy type of K. By restricting discrete Morse functions to those induced by total orders on the vertices, we develop a strong discrete Morse theory, generalizing the strong collapses introduced by Barmak and Minian. We show that, in this setting, the resulting reduced CW-complex is regular, enabling us to recover its homotopy type combinatorially. We also provide an algorithm to compute this reduction and apply it to obtain efficient structures for complexes in the library of triangulations by Benedetti and Lutz.

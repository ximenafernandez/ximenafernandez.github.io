<p style="font-size:11pt;">
(with E. Borghini, P. Groisman and G. Mindlin) <span style="font-size:11pt; font-style:italic"> We address the problem of estimating 
intrinsic distances in a manifold from a finite sample. We prove that the metric
 space defined by the sample endowed with a computable metric known as sample Fermat
 distance converges a.s. in the sense of Gromov-Hausdorff. The limiting object is the
 manifold itself endowed with the population Fermat distance, an intrinsic metric 
that accounts for both the geometry of the manifold and the density that produces
 the sample. This result is applied to obtain sample persistence diagrams that
 converge towards an intrinsic persistence diagram. We show that this method 
outperforms more standard approaches based on Euclidean norm with theoretical
 results and computational experiments.</span>
